        The user should be to do the following

     *  Add a new book – 
     * If a user chooses this option, he or she should then be prompted for the author, title, and price of that book. 
     * You may assume that all info is typed correctly and that it is really a new book (i.e. it’s not already listed in the inventory). 
     * The program should then add this book to the list with three copies in stock.
     * 
        List all in-stock books – 
        Print (in a neatly formatted way) 
        all the books in the inventory that are in stock with all of their associated information. 
        The program should print the message “No books in the inventory” 
        if there are (duh!) no books in the inventory, or “No books in stock” 
        if there are (double duh!) no books in stock.

        List all the books by a particular author – 
        The user should be prompted for the author’s name. 
        Print all the information associated with each book by that author. 
        If there are no such books, print an appropriate message instead. 
        (Print info for books in or out of stock.)

        Record a purchase - 
        Prompt the user for the title of the book bought, and how many copies were purchased. 
        If there are enough copies in stock, the total price paid for the books should be added to the total revenue, 
        the number of copies sold should be incremented appropriately, 
        and the number of copies in stock should be decremented appropriately. 
        If there aren’t enough copies, print an error message. 
        You can assume the title actually exists in the inventory,
         and that the number of copies purchased is a non-negative integer.
        Print the total price paid to the screen.

        Print all “best sellers” – 
        Print the information for the book(s) that sold the most copies. 
        If there is more than one such book, print all of them. (So if no books are sold, you’ll print all the books. 
        If there are no books in the inventory, print an appropriate message. 
        A book can be a best seller even if it’s out of stock.)
        Refresh inventory – Set the number of copies in stock of all books in the inventory back to three.

        Close the program – 
        This should print the total revenue earned during the program’s execution and then quit the program.
