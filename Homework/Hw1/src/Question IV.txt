Question IV: Where superclassVar is a variable of a superclass that references an object whose type is a subclass, what is necessary for this statement to compile?

During run time, will method methodName from the class that is the type of superclassVar always be invoked, or is it possible that a different method methodName will be invoked? Explain your answer.
    
    1. The name of the subclass in variable declaration is necessary for superclassVar to compile since it works like all other variables. If a method methodName were to return the object, it would need the name of the subclass in the declaration of the method.

    2. During run time, it is possible for a different method from the method within the superclass because subclass’ methods can override a superclass’s methods with param override which pushes it over the method with that variable.
